Hi everyone,
<pre>
I started my PhD at Polytechnique in biomedical engineering. My research focuses on analyzing structural pediatric brain MRI data to understand neurodevelopment. Previously, I studied the potential use of deep learning based techniques for deformable image registration using T1-weighted images from the Calgary Preschool Dataset. I am interested in anything health related and how we can improve these systems world-wide!
