### Project Title: Exploratory Work on the Predictive Clinical Neuroscience (PCN) Toolkit


## Background

## Objectives
The aim of this project will be decomposed into three sub-objectives:
* Start off with the available tutorial on the PCN toolkit documentation to get familiar to it
* Use another set of data to follow through the available steps that this toolkit offers (to name them here...)
* Adapt some functionnalities which were found to be less intuitive to work with
All of these three sub-objectives will be documented throughout the weeks to be able to be reproduced in later or other exploratory works. 
## Data at Hand

## Tools Used:
- [PCN Toolkit](https://pcntoolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and their [GitHub page](https://github.com/amarquand/PCNtoolkit)
- Python Scripting
